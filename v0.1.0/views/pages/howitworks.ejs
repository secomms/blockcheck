    <h2>How It Works</h2>

    <p>
        Each certified PDF contains embedded metadata with certification information.
        This ensures the document's authenticity and integrity.

            <h3>1. Certificates Aggregation</h3>
            <p>
                Multiple certificates are combined into a <strong>Merkle Tree</strong>.
                Each leaf of the tree represents a single certificate.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Blockchain Anchoring</h3>
            <p>
                The <strong>Merkle Root</strong> of the tree is stored on the blockchain
                through a transaction. This guarantees immutability and tamper-proof verification.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Metadata in the PDF</h3>
            <p>
                Each individual PDF certificate contains the following metadata:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Issuer:</strong> name and wallet of the issuer in order to identify it</li>
                <li><strong>Blockchain:</strong> the blockchain network used</li>
                <li><strong>Transaction hash:</strong> the blockchain transaction storing the Merkle root</li>
                <li><strong>Transaction timestamp: </strong>when the transaction was accepted by the network</li>
                <li><strong>Merkle proof:</strong> the proof that this certificate is part of the Merkle tree</li>
                <li><strong>Expiration:</strong> if the certificate is meant to expire or not</li>
                <li><strong>Version: </strong> version of the mechanism to certify the PDFs</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                When you upload a certificate to our verifier, these metadata are used to confirm
                its authenticity in real-time.
